# Dental Clinic Management System

## Project Description
This project is a console-based Dental Clinic Management System developed using C++. It simulates the core administrative and operational functions of a dental clinic. The system is object-oriented and structured using multiple classes representing doctors, patients, appointments, prescriptions, payments, and inventory.

## Main Features

- **Doctor Management:** Add and display doctors with full profiles including specialization, available days, and hours.
- **Patient Management:** Register and manage patients with personal details, contact info, and medical data (age, gender, blood type).
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Book appointments between patients and doctors on specified dates and times.
- **Prescription Management:** Create and assign prescriptions from doctors to patients, with support for saving notes.
- **Payment Tracking:** Handle service payments and display payment history per patient.
- **Inventory Control:** Manage dental clinic inventory with item names and stock quantities.
- **Data Persistence:** All records are saved to and loaded from a structured external file (`clinic_data.txt`) using file I/O.

## Technical Highlights

- Written entirely in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).
- Uses file handling (`fstream`) to persist data across sessions.
- Modular and scalable code structure using reusable classes.
- Designed for educational purposes or simulation of a real-world dental clinic.
